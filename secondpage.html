The drippy onion is a bit more complicated than all the others. Read his story to understand him more: "Drippy Onion is one of the drippiest vegetables you have ever seen. He is the most precise and the bravest onion of them all. The drippy onion has quite an interesting story, to begin with. 3 days ago the drippy onion was grown, at first, no one saw the potential in him, but only her mother Photosynthesis knew that he has the biggest drip that everyone is going to remember forever and just 5 days later the Drippy onion has entered the Open sea of drip. The Drippy onion is still dripping out somewhere, waiting for the new owner."</p></div>
